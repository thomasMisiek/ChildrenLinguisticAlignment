# children-linguistic-alignment

children-linguistic-alignment allows to compute the semantic, lexical and syntactic similarity between couples
of consecutive utterances retrieved from the CHILDES database, as well as several other measures.
6 languages available: English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese and Japanese.

## Installation

Install the project by cloning it on your computer or by downloading a compressed version

## Usage

Use the Run notebook, where an example call is already set up

Or you can also run the script run.py

For example: python run.py French_20_25 French 20 25 True
<br />

<ul>
<li>with French_20_25 being the name of the directory where the results will be stored (can be any name) but mandatory</li>
<li>with French being the language used to retrieve data from CHILDES. Mandatory</li>
<li>with 20 being the minimal age to be considered. Mandatory</li>
<li>with 25 being the maximal age to be considered. Mandatory</li>
<li>and True stating if the program is in test mode or not. Optional, default value: False</li>
</ul>

## Methods and how to interpret the results

After the end of a run, all the results are stored in Databases/your_directory_name/results.
To each treated age correspond a CSV file containing similarity measurements and other relevant data.
Here is an exhaustive list of the columns of the CSV file, what is contained in them, and how it is processed.

#### condition

"rand_ex" if both utterances are taken at random in the whole CHILDES dataset (of the same language).
</br>
"rand_in" if both utterances are taken at random in the same transcript (conversation).
</br>
"chi->par" if the child speak first then the parent, and both utterances are strictly consecutive.
</br>
"par->chi" if the parent speak first then the child, and both utterances are strictly consecutive.
</br>
In "rand_in" and "rand_ex", the direction of speech make non sense, as utterances are almost never consecutive
